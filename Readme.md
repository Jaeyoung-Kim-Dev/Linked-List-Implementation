<h1 align="center">Welcome to Linked List Implementation ðŸ‘‹</h1>

## What project is it?

> This is Linked List Implementation, a project I did in the second semester of college <a href="https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/diplomas/information-technology" target='_blank'>(SAIT)</a>.

## What is the purpose of the project?

> This implements the abstract data type for a singly-linked list, which is an interface containing the signatures for the methods/operations that can be performed on the linked list. The given interface contains an object data type, which will be stored in the linked list and is to be considered when implementing the linked list. It tests Linked List through PassTests and PassFailTests claases. Also tests User class' serialization and deserialization through SerializationPassTests class.

Testing: JUnit

## Functionality (Linked List interface contains)

- Prepend an item to the beginning of the linked list.
- Append an item to the end of the linked list.
- Insert an item at a specific index in the linked list.
- Replace an item in the linked list.
- Retrieve an item at an index in the linked list.
- Get the index of an item in the linked list.
- Check if a linked list has an item.
- Clear all items in the linked list.
- Get the number of items in the linked list.
- Delete an item at an index in the linked list.

## Serialization

> The Linked List is serialized. An object of the linked list is able to be stored a binary file. The object is able to be reconstructed from its binary file.
> The supplied User class in the problemdomain package is used as the data type for the items in the linked list.

#### Serialization Pass Tests

> Example user data in the test

1.  User(1, "Joe Blow", "jblow@gmail.com", "password");
2.  User(2, "Joe Schmoe", "joe.schmoe@outlook.com", "abcdef");
3.  User(3, "Colonel Sanders", "chickenlover1890@gmail.com", "kfc5555");
4.  User(4, "Ronald McDonald", "burgers4life63@outlook.com", "mcdonalds999");
