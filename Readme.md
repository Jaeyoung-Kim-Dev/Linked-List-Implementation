1. A project title:
Linked List, Testing and Serialization 


2. What the program does:
This implements the abstract data type for a singly-linked list, which is an interface containing the signatures for
the methods/operations that can be performed on the linked list.
The given interface contains an object data type, which will be stored in the linked list and is to be considered when implementing the linked list.
It tests Linked List through PassTests and PassFailTests claases. Also tests User class' serialization and deserialization through SerializationPassTests class.
